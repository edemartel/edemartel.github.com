This month saw the release of the highly anticipated _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_, usually known as MGSV. The game received glowing reviews accross the boardw, ith a metascore of 93 at the time of writing, was somewhat divisive amongst the existing fan base, and overall looks like a somewhat pleasant if unpolished fuck fest.

Also in the news was the rather rocky end of the development cycle, which saw Kojima Productions, MGSV's developer and series creator Hideo Kojima's studio get closed by parent company Konami. Kojima himself got axed, and Konami wants to move away from AAA games in general. Kojima has joked several times that every MGS game in the series was the last, but now with those events, it really seems it's gonna be the end of it, for real this time. And this is the way the world ends: not with a bang, but a whimper.

I didn't play MGSV, and I don't plan to play it. But my reasons for doing so might surprise you.

<!-- more -->

For you see, MGS is a franchise I've been following for some time. It's just like with _Final Fantasy_: I've never played any game in the series, yet I find the entire context surrounding it quite fascinating to say the least. Bunnyhop's _Critical Closeups_ on the first three games MGS titles are probably amongst the most interesting video game analyses I have ever seen, although that might be because George Weidman is a human-shaped blob of awesomeness.

So I originally figured MGSV would be my first entry into the series, but then Konami decided to show us how much they were assholes, and that made me reconsider the whole thing. And now I'm at the point that if I ever buy this, it'll be for dirt cheap and I'll probably give something to charity as well just to be sure. Because Konami are indeed the biggest bunch of twatcakes in the entire games industry. That's right, even more than EA. If you want to know why, Jim Sterling has [a very accurate writeup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uphcEJW-MDA).

### Criticizing versus supporting

Now, you might think it's a bit weird to refuse to buy a game because of the actions of its publishers. After all, we should always keep a work and its creator separate, right? And yes, in a sense, it is true that the identity of an artist should not factor in your evaluation of its creation, as it doesn't matter. Just because Beck is affiliated with Scientology doesn't mean his music is suddenly shit. Because it isn't shit. It's great. Great all around.

So, yeah, just because Konami are a blight on video gaming doesn't mean I should touch their game, right? Well, not really. Because Konami are not the creator here. Kojima is. And if Kojima was the problem I wouldn't be caring. Yeah, he might be a bit weird and he writes like a sewer backup, but he's still one of gaming's last remaining author and in any case, who he is doesn't matter when analyzing the things he creates. But this is only true if you're talking about critique.

Giving money to someone in exchange of a cultural product means you're supporting that person's work. By paying a creator, you're essentially saying: "I want you to keep creating more products so that I can keep consuming them". Buying is endorsing, and that's why a journalist writing about someone that they're financially supporting through crowdfunding initiatives [is a breach of ethics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-7RLxrsJ04&t=4m6s).

Normally, that wouldn't be an issue. If I purchase, say, _Civilization V_, yes, I giving money to 2K Games, but I'm also telling them that I want Firaxis to continue making more games in general and more _Civ_ titles in particular. But in Konami's case, we already know that they don't want to make more AAA titles, much less actual MGS games, so any money raised through the sales of MGSV will instead go the development of pachinko machines and F2P bullshit, and that is not an enterprise I will be a part of. If I knew my money would somehow go to Kojima, then that's a bullet I would be ready to bite, but in the current state of affairs, it won't happen.

### Back your favorites

Now, you might think this is it for this article. I won't buy MGSV because at this point all the money injected into it will go to help something I despise. But there's a related subject I want to talk about, and also because I can't always end on a very negative an ranty note. It all started when Jim Sterling mentionned that Konami seems to believe that really anyone can make a game if given enough time and money, and that's why _Silent Hill_ had been outsourced to a variety of low level Western developers with no actual understanding of what make _Silent Hill_ great. And that opinion, that "games are made magically", is something I think many people hold.

For you see, games are hard to make. Incredibly hard. Even the smallest and artiest of indie games require a tremendous amount of effort to produce. And in at the end of the day, the single biggest decider of whether or not a game will be good is the talent of its developers.
