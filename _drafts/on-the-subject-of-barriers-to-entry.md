I've been gaming for most of my life. It all started several years ago, playing _Super Mario Bros_ on the NES. Over the course of my childhood, I spent countless hours playing games on Nintendo consoles. I slowed down during the sixth generation, yet for some reason the games that had a biggest impact on me are nearly all GameCube exclusives. Things ramped up again when I managed to get a decent income and I got my hands on a PS3, and these days I'm always playing something on my PC. For me, gaming is a second nature.

A [recent study](http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/ESA_EF_2013.pdf) by the ESA claims Americans have spent more then 20 _billion_ dollars in games in 2012. The same study says that 58% of Americans play video games. That leaves 42% who don't. That's a lot of people. I mean, I'm fairly certain that you'd be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't watch movies. Games have been part of the mainstream for more than 25 years now. Though, in my opinion, games are their own mainstream. Unless you're in it, you won't see that it's such a big deal. For most people, video games are either murder simulators or pointless passtimes for children. After all, that's the media exposure they get, and many games are explicitly marketed at teenagers.

Back to my experience as gamer. I like games. I like them a lot. When I'm not playing, I'm thinking about them. Games are not only my primary form of entertainment, but also my favorite form of artistic expression.
