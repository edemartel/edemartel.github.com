I wanted to write about this for a while. In fact, this very subject was the main reason I wanted to open a blog. I initially decided to wait a bit, but a friend of mine sent me a very interesting article today. So, without further ado, let's talk about fan service in video games, more specifically in _League of Legends_.

<!-- more -->

Let's look at Katarina and Nidalee, two of _League of Legends_' champions (click on the images to enlarge them).

What do you notice? Nothing? How about Sona and Miss Fortune?

Yeah, they're all busty as hell, and in many. And don't think it's just these fours: it's shorter to list the female champions that are _not_ well endowed. And it's not just their proportions, it's also their clothing. What's going on?

According to Guinsoo, game designer for Riot Games (developer of _League of Legends_'):
> One other note is that it's hard to make attractive female champions that look female in our engine unless the boobs are noticable.
> Unless the boobs are big, you won't see them in game, and if you don't see them in game, it will look more masculine.

So, they made them curvy to made them easily distinguishable from male champions. Fair enough. Although that does not make a lot of sense when you think about it. In game, you don't really care if a champion is male or female, because each champion is easily distinguishable from each other thanks to his body shape, clothing and body language. As such, when Miss Fortune comes down the lane, you know it's her, not because of her breasts, but because she looks and moves like Miss Fortune, and you know she's female because she sure as hell looks female on the loading screen. So, making them busty is a purely artistic decision. That begs the question: why have they chosen busty females as their art direction? A possible explanation can be found in stats Riot has released several months ago: 90% of their player base is male, and 85% is between the age of 16 and 30. So it pretty much looks like standard issue fan service (the use of sex appeal to drive sales) to me.

Now, before you go all neckbeard on me, keep in mind that I don't really mind the tits. Although it does raise a few questions. For instance, does that imply that combat prowess, in the universe of _League of Legends_, is directly proportional with breast size? That's a rather interesting case of elitism. Also, as far as feminism go, in Runeterra (_LoL_'s world), women are just as likely to kick ass as men. In _LoL_, there is no such thing as a damsel in distress. And anyway, the fan service is getting less and less prevalent as time goes forward, which suggests that they're changing their view of it. And anyway, male champions are almost all incredibly muscular monstrosities.

So, again, I don't really care. Women are not harmed by Riot's decision to make the average Runeterran cup size a D. So why am I bringing that up now?

It's that article I was talking about. It's [up on Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/HughJeremy/20130806/197722/Ending_Booby_Armour_Creating_art_and_not_just_for_arts_sake.php), but in short, it's about how Unknown Worlds, developers of _Natural Selection 2_, added a female character in the game, one that wasn't scantily clad or sporting ridiculous assets, and how it sparked a huge (positive) discussion on their forums. If you're quick on the TL;DR, just scroll down and look at the first image that crosses your field of vision. You'll see what I mean.

I guess it shows gaming is moving forward. I mean, sure, we still have things like [_Dragon's Crown_'s sorceress](http://images.pushsquare.com/news/2013/04/saucy_sorceress_trailer_deployed_for_ps3_and_vita_brawler_dragons_crown/attachment/0/large.jpg), but they're getting rarer (and anyway, Japan isn't known for its forward treatment of women). Maybe it's just my optimism speaking, but I think that things are going to get better as society as a whole evolves.

I still don't know how to fix the [douchebag problem](http://fatuglyorslutty.com/), however. I don't think there's an actual solution to that one. At least their behavior is no longer encouraged. Except on Reddit. But Reddit is the scum of the Web, so that's to be expected. But we still have to do something, because otherwise the hardcore gaming scene will remain a sausage fest. But that's a subject for another article.

So, yeah. Don't whine about the tits, just carry harder. Preferably with a female champion, just to show them you can still fuck everyone up with two X chromosomes.
