Despite my status as a tools programmer for a medium sized game casual game developer, I have this dream to eventually make my own games. Unfortunately, I'm a bit too ambitious for my own good, which means I would need an actual team, which I would need to pay, and that requires a business plan and other stuff that I can't be assed to actually do. Maybe one day. Until then, I can always keep thinking about it.

<!-- more -->

I got a bunch of concepts lying around, a few of which are pretty well developed. One of those is an Zelda-like action/adventure title which also draws inspiration from, of all things, _Metroid Prime_ and _Resident Evil 4_. And, working on it, I wondered for a while about which gender I should give to my protagonist

I'll ask you a question: what would you pick? Think about it, then when you're done, keep reading.

Alright. Did you pick a gender matching your own? Or something completely different? Perhaps somewhere in the middle?

Trick question: whatever you picked is meaningless because _such question is equally meaningless_. The gender of a the player character should not matter unless your game deals with themes that somehow relate to that gender. So, if you explore concepts such as misoginy, then making your protagonist female would allow for some pretty interesting stuff. But otherwise, you might as well flip a coin. Or, considering how complex the issues of gender are these days, throw a twenty-sided die.

So, what did I pick? Well, I went for a man. Partly because I'm male myself, but mostly because back when I started designing the whole thing, I didn't really care about those kind of issues, so I just went with the "default" choice. Call me lazy, but even then I don't see how going for something less common would actually improve the story. The game deals with pretty interesting themes already, but none of them are relevant to gender. It is not something I consider worth talking about in there. Just because I like gushing about gender issues in real life doesn't mean I want all my plots to be about them. A little bit of variety, you know.

Which leads me back to my original point: a story has only a finite amount of space, so you need to be selective. Only tell what is required to understand the plot and the underlying themes, and leave the rest to the imagination. If your story has no romance or sex in it, there is no point in telling us about your protagonist's sexual orientation. Leave that open. You'll make all those female slashfic writers much more happy.
