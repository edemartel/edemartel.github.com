So, I know this guy who's quite the conspiracy nut. Whenever something happens, he always jumps on the fringe theories. And that led me to do some thinking on that subject: variable critical sense.

So, I like to think of myself as a scientist: after all, "science" is written on my degree. I also like to think that I'm able to spot bullshit when I see it. Although I realize that I'm about as biased as anybody. But that's beside the point.

When someone tells me "don't trust anything you see on the Internet", and that I should double check the facts and cross reference the data, I'm down. I mean, it's important to validate any claim someone makes. When I deal with conspiracy theorists, they usually go with "don't trust the mainstream media". Again, sure, nobody is perfect and even outlets with the best of intentions can make mistakes. Let's not forget [Hanlon's razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor) after all.

And then said theorists go and share an article written on some blog, and expect me to swallow it whole without double checking anything. Why the double standard? Because when a guy on a blog tells about "what really happened" for some event, and I decide to Google it, the only other sources I find are either links to the article, or wholesale copy-and-paste jobs of it. It's like one big human centipede of unchecked data. And the fact that the article is written by one unknown guy should make it more trustworthy. I don't know who he is, what his credentials are, or who he works for. I mean, I'm not saying the mainstream media outlets have my best interests at heart, but at least I can find their offices on Google Maps.

I asked earlier "why the double standard", but it's a rhetorical question, because I know exactly what's going on: it's another case of a cognitive bias. The theorist blindly accepts the article because it already fits with his beliefs, and rejects the mainstream because it's in contradiction with them. When they say "don't trust the mainstream", what they really mean is "don't trust those I disagree with".

And it's alright. You know what? You can believe what ever you want. But don't try to claim you have great ability for critical thinking when you're just as biased as anyone else. Yes, everyone thinking that something is true doesn't mean it is. But on the other hand, if you're the only one who's driving on the wrong side of the road, perhaps it would be a good moment to stop and ponder a bit.

But of course it's a "maybe". As Orwell put it, all issues are politcal issues, and even something as "pure" as science is driven by political and ideological decisions. Reason is an abstract concept that is hard to put in practice, and in the end, we should all exercise caution. When someone shows you facts that suggest a certain thing, maybe he's not showing you everything. For example, most theories related to "9/11 was an inside job" rely heavily on cherry picking and reality distortion.

Which begs the question: if you need to be dishonest in order to get your point across, should you really be considered as "trustworthy"? If you think so, and you back it by saying that your "opponents" are doing the same thing, then I'm afraid I will have to put you in the "head stuck up your ass" category of people I know.
