So, as a many of you already know, I'm a gamer. I play lots of games, of all kinds and shapes and genres, on all kinds of platforms. I play  to get either some mindless fun, a competitive edge or some food for though. In short, playing video games is my preferred way of consuming art. I also happen to work in the games industry, and I try to stay on top of what's going on in that wacky world, where pretentious hipsterism sits next to business-class bullshit.

And after gaming for a while, I noticed something: we don't like to think very often in our games.

<!-- more -->

So, plenty of games are what I call _deep_, that is, they have multiple layers of interpretation, and causes you to stop and think about it long after you've stopped playing them. Many of them raise some interesting questions or approach tough issues. _Far Cry 3_ shows how easy it is for anyone to become a monster, _Majora's Mask_ is about how loneliness can turn mischief into evil, _EarthBound_ is essentially a metaphor for a child growing up and losing his innocence, _Bastion_ describes how pointless it is to constantly live in the past, _BioShock_ analyses objectivism, _Spec Ops: The Line_ brutally deconstructs the entire modern military shooter genre... I could go on for days.

I think we need more. Way more. Why are so many games so shallow? I'm using "depth" here to refer to something that can be understood in different ways depending on how much time you spent thinking about it. In games, the surface level is usually just the gameplay mechanics, along with a linear structure of various story events. Many games just stay there: recent _Call of Duty_ titles are basically "America is in danger", and never go past that. There is nothing to analyze because there is nothing below the surface. _Far Cry 3_, mentionned above, looks like a pretty but bland sandbox first person shooter with minor role playing elements, but it's when you start thinking about what the events that unfold and your role in them that you realize how deep the rabbit hole goes. That said, FC3 is pretty light in that regard. 

Now, it may seem like it's only a story thing, which might seem weird because, as we all know, games shine the most when they fully utilize their interactivity, or their potential for agency. But it's not just the plot: game stories are interactive, and as such allows for a much wider range of possible interpretations than other mediums, such as film. Since it's essentially you in there, how you play and how you react to events influences how the story progresses, whether it's only in your understanding of the situation or an actual impact on the game's events, depending on how "linear" or "open" the game is.

### "This is all your fault"

Let's look at _Spec Ops: The Line_, for example. It's about a team of Delta Force operators on a search and rescue mission in Dubai after it's been hit by a sandstorm. While the beginning looks like a generic modern military shooter in which you shoot Arab-looking people holding AK-47s, as the game progresses, however, it becomes clear that this is not your father's _Call of Duty_ ripoff, as you start fighting rogue American soldiers and everything goes right to hell. Along the way, you get to make some terrible decisions that the game forces you to do, and then chastises you for doing. And of course there's post traumatic stress disorder thrown in there for good measure. And at the end, when you feel like an asshole, someone says to your character: "None of this would have happened if you'd just stopped." Except he's not really saying it to the protagonist. He's saying it to you, the player.

SOTL is not being a very good game. The mechanics are sloppy, it's very short, and it's not very fun. It can even be quite painful at times, and I could only play it in short sessions. And yet, it's a very engaging experience. Why is that? Because it's subtle. Sure, on a surface level, it can be incredibly heavy handed, but if you take the time to really think about it, you'll come to realize all kinds of funky things. Like that not everything might be true in this. Or that you have many more options during the various "moral dilemmas" sections than you might thing. Or all the little details, like your finishing moves becoming even more violent and brutal as the game progresses. Also, the above quote? That's an actual loading screen tip from the game. All in all, it's one hell of a ride. 

For me, it's one of the best games of 2012. And yet, SOTL sold [less than a million units](http://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/?name=Spec+Ops%3A+The+Line) since its release a year ago. In the AAA world, it's next to nothing. And I think it deserves to be played, so I'm advertising it. Keep in mind that the game is short, so I recommend only picking it up if you can get it for less than 10$. Until then, Extra Credits has an excellent two-parter about the game: [part one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjaBsuXWJJ8) is relatively spoiler free, and [part two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJZIhcCA2lk) is a spoiler fest. I agree with most of what they're saying, so it's a pretty good way to just get lazy and let them do my work for me. There's also [Yahtzee's review](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNhPMjbgkXA), if you're still undecided. 

### Let's flip things around

I'm bringing all that because I think that we, the gamers, should encourage those kinds of games. Games that try to bring new things to the table, not just on the gameplay front but also on the depth front. Games that want to make us think about them when we're not playing them. Games that challenge what we believe, games that drill into our skulls, games that are art. As such, I'm going to do my part: if I encounter such a game, I'm going to talk about it on this blog, and then you can all go and buy it. Sounds good? In the meantime, you can check out my [Steam recommendations](http://steamcommunity.com/id/icekeese/recommended/).

While you're at it, buy _Bastion_. And _Transistor_ when it comes out (and since it won't be on the Xbox One, I already know which console I'm not getting).
