So, as a many of you already know, I'm a gamer. I play lots of games, of all kinds and shapes and genres, on all kinds of platforms. I play  to get either some mindless fun, a competitive edge or some food for though. In short, playing video games is my preferred way of consuming art. I also happen to work in the games industry, and I try to stay on top of what's going on in that wacky world, where pretentious hipsterism sits next to business-class bullshit.

And there's something I noticed in games: no matter how "mature" our games get, we don't really like to talk about hard matters or to ask tough questions.

<!-- more -->

Let me explain. It's been a while since video games have been a child-centric medium. Now, most gamers are adults, and half of them are female. And while many of them play casual titles, I'm going to focus on the more "hardcore" games for the purpose of this article. The heavy hitters, in terms of sales, in the hardcore gaming scene are either sports games or shooters. And those shooters can get incredibly violent and graphic, a fact made more apparent by the increasing graphical fidelity made possible by modern gaming hardware and development techniques. And yet, that violence is usually presented as a side effect of a standard juvenile power fantasy: you're a one man army with regenerating health against an army of people with no real background and you're shooting them because... _something_. There's rarely any context on _why_ you're doing that.

_Why?_ That's an interesting question. Because we're pretty good on the _what?_, I mean, what you're doing is shooting baddies. But who are you? Who sent you there? Who are these people you're shooting? Why are you shooting at them? Why isn't there any civilian around? Those questions are left unanswered. And you're left to wonder why you were ordered to blow up those blinking dots with that remote controlled air-to-ground cannon. Well, that's if you actually pause and ask yourself that.

### Juvenile violence

So I was thinking about that a lot, and it made me realized that, even though games can be quite violent and vulgar, they're hardly what I'd call "mature". Again, it's incredibly juvenile: you're essentially a teenager who thinks that firing a gun at people is going to make him a man. And while many games are set in a war setting, they hardly ever talk about all the cans of worms that go with war, such as the effects of war on civilian populations, or post-traumatic stress disorder. In short, war is just a convenient setting for the killing to take place, and you happen to control some unfeeling robot. And what unsettles me the most is that those games usually take themselves very seriously. Let's be honest: _Modern Warfare 2_ was barely deeper than _G.I. Joe_ as far as difficult subjects go.

When games are rated "M" (17 years and older), it usually means it's going to feature a lot of blood, but little else. Said differently, the container is mature, but the content isn't.

### Let's flip things around

So I initially intended this to be just some sort of rant to let out some accumulated steam, but then I saw on VGChartz that _Spec Ops: The Line_ [didn't even sell a million units](http://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/?name=Spec+Ops%3A+The+Line), despite being an incredible piece of interactive storytelling and one of the best games of 2012. When Atomic Games tried to make [a game based on the Second Battle of Fallujah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Days_in_Fallujah), people got angry and said that "war is not a game". Then Konami got scared of losing sales and pulled out of the project. If someone had decided to make a film out of that, it would probably go and win awards. So why can't games talk about things that are good enough for the other artistic mediums?

I'm not saying we should stop making mindlessly fun games. As I said above, I too like myself some dumb entertainment once in a while. But I also like to stop and think. Why are indies the only ones who try to bring new things to the table? Why can't we have complex themes _and_ great production values? On the same subject, why can't we have fast paced action that makes us ponder things when we are not playing? Sure, many AAA titles try to change things up, but for every _Far Cry 3_, _BioShock_ or _Half-Life 2_, there's a dozen of _Gears of War_ or _Call of Duty_ clones who don't give two shits about that.

I think the real problem lies with us, the gamers. We like our comfort zone a little too much. And so, I'll try to do my part. If I encounter something that blows my mind, I'll talk about it here. And then you can go out and buy it. For now, I'd recommend you to buy [_Spec Ops_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/50300/), but the game is really short, so wait until you can get it for less than 10$. Until then, Extra Credits has an excellent two-parter on it: the [first part](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjaBsuXWJJ8) being spoiler-free, and the [second part](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJZIhcCA2lk) being a spoil fest.
