Oh boy, it's been a while since I've written something here. This summer was quite eventful at work, and then I also had to take some vacation time during which I watched Summer Games Done Quick and then went away in the woods, so I kinda left my blog behind. And anyway, I didn't find anything interesting to talk about, and the few things that happened in the gaming world had already been covered in greater and better detail that I ever could, so.

I had started ordering parts for a new PC, which I'm not writing this article on. While that was going on, my then-current PC's graphic card messed up, and my procrastinating reflexes slowed the whole process. Anyway, long story short, I barely played on a PC during the summer. Instead I dusted off my various consoles and played on that.

### Summer platforming and summer reruns

First off: _Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze_. That started off well, and then quickly went to hell. Honestly, it's probably my biggest disappointment this year, as I always placed great confidence in Retro Studios' development skills. And, well, what a mess. Everything in that game feels off, with the one exception being the soundtrack, although even then I wonder if it's just my nostalgia speaking, as so many of its themes are just remixes of songs from previous _Donkey Kong Country_ titles.

_Tropical Freeze_ makes the cardinal sin of having slippery controls in a game that requires precision platforming. Everything has inertia and weight, as if they just dumped a realistic physics middleware in the middle of it and then just went off to the pub. The game looks good, sure, but so much of that is spent on backgrounds that fight for your attention while you should really be focusing on the platforms in the foreground. All in all, it looks like a tech demo that had some gameplay hastily thrown on top of it. Oh, and the underwater levels are a nightmare.

Now, I'm not saying that it's shit. It's still decent. It's just that since playing _Rayman Origins_ and _Rayman Legends_, I have very specific criteria about what should go in a 2D platformer, and _Tropical Freeze_ doesn't have that. So, basically what I'm saying is that its biggest flaw is that it's not _Rayman Legends_.

Speaking of the limbless wonder, I found out that _Rayman: Revolution_, the enhanced port of _Rayman 2_ for PS2, is available on PS3. The emulation appears near perfect, with any kind of framerate drop also being present in the original version. As for the PS2 port's features, well, all of them actively detract from the overall experience, so if you should really play it on a PC, a N64 or, better yet, a Dreamcast.

I had played some of _Rayman 2_ back on the N64 back during my childhood, although I never managed to get very far as I didn't own a controller pack and therefore couldn't save my game. Playing _Revolutions_ on the PS3, I was fascinated by how little of the game I remembered, and how well it still held up even by today's standards. Okay, the camera is a bit wonky, especially during combat encounters, but flying in the sanctuary of rock and lava feels better than that damn rocket barrel in _Tropical Freeze_ despite similar control schemes. It's to the point where most of the game's problems can be explained away by it being one of the first 3D platformers. I mean, they were discovering and learning how to do it while they were doing it, and they still managed to ship one of the best games of all time. Seriously, give it a shot.

I also managed to recover my GameCube, although I had to order a new memory card and therefore had lost all my saves. That wasn't really a problem, since I just wanted to start some new games with _Metroid Prime_ and its sequel, along with _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_. I even tried some _Super Mario Sunshine_ for about 30 minutes before getting bored and not touching it. Overall it's been some great fun, lying on my couch with a controller in hand, revisiting all these excellent titles which all have something interesting to give, even today.

### About that title

So now we're halfway through the article and there's no sign of its title. What's up with that?

Well, I was coming up to that. You see, two weeks ago I discovered that _Okami_ was on sale on the PlayStation Store. Well, _Okami HD_, it's enhanced PS3 port, was. I always wanted to try it out, so try it out I did, and oh boy it's one of my favorite games I played this year.

Going in I didn't really know what to expect. All I kept hearing about _Okami_ was that it was "the best _Zelda_ game that isn't _Zelda_". And turns out it's only partially accurate? Well, not even that much. It definitely belongs in that catch-all "action adventure" genre that _Zelda_ is also found in, but that doesn't say a lot. I'm pretty sure _Zelda_ was the main inspiration during its design, but in the end it stands fairly apart from its spiritual predecessor.

For the uneducated, _Okami_ is a melting pot of Japanese myths and folklore, dressed up in a cel-shaded rendering scheme that looks like ink wash paintings, and built on mechanics that are, for the most part, fairly unique and interesting. Most of the gameplay is centered around the "Celestial Brush", which allows casting spells by drawing on a canvas. This is used for combat, navigation, and puzzle solving. Skills are initially obtained at a very fast pace, which helps keep things flowing nicely, although that pace slows down near the end, so there's that. Additionally, combat is exclusively performed in small, instanced areas, which turns any non-boss encounter into a combo-building brawl.

As for the plot itself, well, it did manage to keep me on my toes. Most of the story is focused on the variety of compelling characters you encounter over the course of your adventure, and there always seems to be something bigger going on than you first thought. If there's one thing I disliked about it, however, is how the game seems to take a lot of time to explain things that should already be obvious. My guess is that they play-tested it with idiots.

So why did I say it didn't really feel like _Zelda_? Well, there's an overworld, and there's dungeons with bosses, and there's generally an ability in that dungeon that you use for the boss, but it's not really that cut-and-dried, and overall I didn't really feel I was playing _Zelda_ but with different characters and painting replacing the items. It's hard to explain in words, really. I guess what I can say is that it stands proudly as its own special cultural piece. Although, to be fair, it could probably easily get turned into a full-fledged _Zelda_ game by just changing the story. Well, I say "easily"... you get the point.

All in all, it's fun, varied and _huge_. It took me 20 hours to blast through the main quest, and there's plenty of things I left behind. There's even a "new game+" feature! It definitely is a great game and I'm glad I got to play it. It gave me a lot of things to think about, so expect more on related subjects in the future.

And now that I got a new PC, I can finally play all these games I had to skip! Right now I'm focusing on _The Witcher 3_ and _DOOM_, with more things coming in the pipeline. I'll keep you posted!

See y'all!
