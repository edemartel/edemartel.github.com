So, _Call of Duty_, subtitled _Advanced Warfare_, has come out recently. And well, it's about good Americans versus evil mercenaries, and it covers ripped-from-the-headlines issues like security and privacy. Because the advantage you have with PMCs is that you're not offending anyone when you shoot at them, unlike when you do so with Russia or some middle eastern country. On the scale of cartoon evil, mercenaries are only one step above Nazis. And they're at their evilest when they come to take our hard earned freedoms because humans can't be trusted with that. Makes me wonder why they did not just pick Abstergo as the villain there. Oh, right, intellectual properties.

In short, it's about as [cynical](http://www.nowgamer.com/features/2389192/is_call_of_duty_advanced_warfare_too_cynical.html) as any other _Call of Duty_ title since _Modern Warfare 2_. But at least, with MW2 and its sequel, you could squint your eyes and think it's actually a parody. But the more recent games in the series really wants us to take them seriously.

The _Battlefield_ series has similar problems since its eleventh title (called _Battlefield 3_ just to screw with your head): it ships with a poorly made single player campaign. Super Bunnyhop has already covered most of its problems [in an excellent review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErTQh9INneY). I suggest you check it out. As for _Battlefield 4_, I can't personally say, since I didn't try it, but judging from reviews, it seems like they didn't learn anything.

_Medal of Honor_ (the 2010 reboot) features an insultingly linear railroad with little to no context, although, in this case, if you want to know who you're shooting at and why you're doing it, you might as well just check the news because it's a real life setting: the war in Afghanistan. No such luck with BF3's campaign, however, which is about... bullshit, really. At least its multiplayer mode is good. Great, even. But that's not what this article is about. No, this article is about how war isn't cool.

### The problem(s) with military shooters

Lack of proper context is an incredibly common problem with the plots of modern military shooters. Come to think of it, WW2 shooters also had the same issue, except they had it much easier because most people automatically assume that Nazis are evil, and as such you don't need to justify anything. Just show the player a few swastikas and you're good to go. In modern shooters, though, nobody takes the time to explain who you're shooting at, and why they're the enemy. They just give you a gun, and tell you to point it at some strangely nondescript characters (typically non-white, but that's another issue entirely), and hope you won't ask too many questions.

Most military themed shooters have the following issues:
- They happen in clean and empty wastelands devoid of any civilians.
- Friendly soldiers are invulnerable and cannot be harmed by your weapons.
- Weapons do not cause visible wounds aside from some pink mist.
- Everyone involved is completely immune to PTSD.

The end result is that, no matter how "realistic" these games claim to be, what they're essentially doing is simulating a battle between unfeeling robots in an artificial environment. You, the player, is not exposed to the various ethical dilemnas that any real soldier will have to face. So, no matter how great the production values, you're still playing with "cowboys vs indians", with the exact same moral implications.

### Why is this such a big deal?

I guess I wouldn't care if it was supposed to be silly and over the top. I mean, _Doom_ never expected you to think it's high brow. But _Call of Duty_ desperately wants you to think it's something more complex than G.I. Joe. Maybe it was once, in _Call of Duty 4_, but since then it's little more than dumb popcorn entertainment, like those Michael Bay films.

Again, you might think it's not that important. But then, what is? In order to push this medium forward, we need to actually look at what we're doing wrong.

In short, you can't have your cake and eat it.
