So, the other day, I had a pretty tough game of _League of Legends_. We got blasted very hard by a single player (who we'll call "Yi"), who had the huge majority of the kills on his team. One of my teammates (who we'll call "Nid") claimed that the reason for that was that this player's champion (the character he was using at that time) was "overpowered". Normally I would just shrug, but this is the Internet.

So I responded. The guy eventually just left the end game lobby (we surrendered quickly), leaving me without someone to debate with. He left with a Parthian shot that was essentially along the lines of "you can't prove that something is broken, so you are right by default". It gave me pause for thought, because it _is_ possible to prove that something is "broken". But first, what do we mean by broken?

Like any game, _League of Legends_ has rules. Breaking those rules is called "cheating". So you'd think that a strategy or character or whatever being "broken" refers to cheating, right? Wrong. Because here's the thing: _LoL_ (as it is often called) is a _video_ game, which means there are ways to enforce the rule even without the presence of an arbiter. Sometimes, people are able to circumvent those ways, through bugs or exploits, but they are swiftly dealt with by the developers.

So what does "broken" means, then? Usually, it is seen as a synonym for "overpowered" ("OP", in short). OP is used to denote any strategy (it can apply to more than that, but I exclusively use it in the context of a strategy) for which the only _legitimate_ (without cheating) _counter_ (a strategy that can be it) is itself. Such strategies are seen as negative to the metagame (the sum of all available strategies for a competitive game) because they kill any creativity, as matches essentially boil down to who can apply the "OP strat" the best. As such, OP strategies are also dealt with accordingly by the developers, through various balance patches. In short, if a rule is deemed flawed, it is corrected.

But what is _really_ OP? As you might think, the definition is vague at best, because if you cannot defeat a strategy, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's overpowered: you might simply be lacking the required skill to deal with it. So, people who cry for the nerfbat might actually be blaming the rules for their own inadequacies. As I often say, "when you suck, blame the game". And therefore, Nid simply meant that you can't really prove that something is really overpowered because there are too many variables to take into account, especially with a game as complex as _League of Legends_.

But here's the thing: it _is_ possible to prove that something is OP. Riot Games, the developers of _LoL_, record [four terabytes](http://slashdot.org/topic/bi/for-riot-games-big-data-is-serious-business/) (that's four thousand gigabytes) of data _per day_ just for the sake of analyzing every match to determine if someone, somewhere, with a specific champion, equipment and mastery/rune set might be too strong against a certain composition. It's mind boggling. Blizzard Entertainment does the same thing for _StarCraft 2_. And so on for any large multiplayer game out there, from _Halo 4_ to _Team Fortress 2_. Everyone does it, because there's so much going on at the same time that humans can't keep up.

And even if they could, humans are biased. Back when I was an avid SC2 player, I hung out a lot on the forums. And what I noticed was that many people were constantly protesting against things they perceived as OP. When balance patches came, it was rarely to address the most commonly complained about issues. Was Blizzard stupid? Of course not. It simply had much more information that we had about the actual state of the game. When you repeatedly lose against something, you might start thinking that perhaps you're not at fault there. After all, you've thrown it all you've got, and you can't win. The proper way to handle it here is to back away for the game and do something else for a while. But in your angry and bitter state, going on your nearest subreddit to whine about a "broken" game might be more cathartic. The problem is that it's not helping. Above all, it's not helping you, because you're not learning from your mistakes by blaming external causes.

If you get nuked by Nidalee's javelin toss, don't claim it's overpowered, learn to dodge instead. You'll get better much more quickly. 

If that sounded self evident, congratulations, you're not a instalocking douchebag.
