Two weeks ago came out _Ori and the Blind Forest_. Reviews were high and the price tag was cheap, and since 2D metroidvania platformers have a special place in my heart, I figured I should give it a try. After six hours and a few hundred deaths, I finished it. The save files claims I'm at 86% completion, which I consider good enough. So, what do I think of _Ori_?

<!-- more -->

Let's put a few things in perspective first. Many people classified _Ori_ as a "metroidvania", which is a portmanteau of _Metroid_ and _Castlevania_, the two series of games which can be credited for inventing, improving on, and popularizing that particular genre. While _Metroid_ is of course the original creator, the _Castlevania_ series brought quite a lot of innovation on the basic formula starting with _Symphony of the Night_, which came out during the fifth generation when _Metroid_ was on a hiatus.

A metroidvania game has a somewhat open level design that encourages and rewards exploration by spreading upgrades and abilities across a large map. As a result, the player will need to backtrack through already visited locations as previously acquired skills enable him or her to reach new areas that were previously blocked off. This in turn has a deep impact not only on level design, but also pacing, character progression and overall combat. While most metroidvanias are 2D platformers, it is not required: _Metroid Prime_ is a first person shooter, for instance.

### _Metroid_, this ain't

And while many people call _Ori_ a metroidvania, I have issues with that.  For starters, there is little to no backtracking involved. The game is split into six major sections: three dungeons and three "preparatory segments" that serve to collect a key that you can use to access each of the dungeons. And in the middle is an additionnal "hub" area. The only backtracking done is through that hub: for each of the other locations, once you're done, you don't have to come back. Many of them don't even feature collectibles, and when they do, you can usually pick them up on your first visit. Some areas even close down after leaving them, preventing further exploration. This is particularly aggravating in the case of the second dungeon, which features optional pick ups that can no longer be obtained after finishing it.

This makes _Ori_, despite what the map screen indicates, an highly linear experience. The corridor you are walking through might have a weird shape, it is still a corridor. In fact, progress is generally gated by story segments rather than with abilities. In fact, I wonder if people would have been so quick to call it a "metroidvania" if the game had sported a level select screen instead of a large connected world?

### So, is it good?

Now, you might think I disliked _Ori and the Blind Forest_. Up until after finishing the first dungeon, I was seriously thinking it would be a GOTY contender. The art, the music, the tight controls, the difficulty curve, everything was so smooth and well designed. I'm thinking about making a metroidvania-style game (don't get your hopes up), and _Ori_ actually made me rethink several elements of my design. I especially like how you can create your own checkpoints.

The combat is interesting in that it's much more akin to a shoot 'em up than a brawler. Because your main form of attack automatically acquires targets, you end up focusing more on dodging enemy attacks while mashing a button to damage them. THe result is frantic and usually quite fun, except when some enemies fire tiny projectiles that become hard to spot in all the action.

But there's several things I can nitpick about. Like, for instance, how the second dungeon forces you to learn an entire new set of mechanics that you will never need ever again. Or how the hit detection isn't alaways accurate. Or how it is sometimes better to tank damage and just run rather than fight. Or how you can technically climb on spikes. Or how some new upgrades make older ones obsolete, which forces the designers to contrive some weird gimmicks to make them relevant again.

But those are just minor nitpicks. No, the major issue I have with _Ori_ is how there's little to no exploring. I never felt like I needed to go and wander around to find new areas to discover and items to collect. There is always one obvious path to follow, and everything is on that path. If you can't get it on your first visit, you'll be able to do so on the way back. All of that didn't matter early on when the map was black, but the more I was progressing, the more I realized how small the world actually is, and how little of it you'll end up seeing. In the end, it makes me wonder if _Ori_ would have been better with a level based structure, like _Rayman_.

But that's not really fair for Moon Studios. They did manage to make a great game. And I guess what really bugs me is that it left me wanting more. That probably means I liked it. That said, I remember _Ori_ more for its sights and its sounds than for its levels and its mechanics. For all intents and purposes, it's a tight little platformer with a few metroidvania-like features thrown in. Dying all the time doesn't really matter when you respawn a few meters  The ending made my eyes water a bit, though. But I'm a sucker for cheesy feels.
