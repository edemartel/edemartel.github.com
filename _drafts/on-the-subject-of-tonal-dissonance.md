Happy new year 2014, dear readers! Let's kick this off by venting the bile I've been accumulating while playing _Bulletstorm_ during the winter holidays.

<!-- more -->

So, _Bulletstorm_, People Can Fly's game about fat space marines hiding behind and cover and killing shit under beautiful skyboxes. Said that way, it does sound a lot like _Gears of War_, eh? Well, there's also Epic Games on the billing, so I guess it's par for the course. Anyway, I enjoyed the game quite a lot. It's been a while since I've played a decent fast paced first person shooter, and I'd recommend this one for its solid mechanics and great weapon design. If this were a micro review, the verdict would be "If you like shooters, buy it on sale".

But this is not a micro review, it's the start of a discussion. _Bulletstorm_ made me think about a weird trend I see in modern video games, which I shall call "tonal dissonance" for the purposes of this article. Tonal dissonance is when the tone of the game changes radically at seemingly random points, as if the designers were unsure of what direction to take. A good example is when a work shifts brutally between humor and drama for no well explained reason.

In _Bulletstorm_'s case, the gameplay segments are over-the-top, ridiculous and obviously meant as a parody of your usual space marine macho adventure, but the cutscenes depict a very serious story about a man's quest for redemption after his lust for revenge led nearly everyone he loved to their death. It becomes difficult to really attach any weight to those serious parts, since as soon as the cutscene ends and you're given control of your character, everyone returns to their goofy and silly selves. It's like there are two stories going on in parallel, featuring sets of pairs of clones with wildy different personalities.

My guess is that the story and the gameplay were handled by two different groups with two different goals in mind. Or, as Yahtzee said in his review:

> It makes me wonder how deep the irony hole really goes and how many of the people involved in development were in on the joke.

I then started drawing parallels with my "[violence in games](http://deliriumcorp.com/2013/11/28/on-the-subject-of-virtual-violence/)" article, in which I explained that extreme blood and gore was regularly used as a substitute for maturity in video games. In _Dead Space_, the tone shifts continuously between _Braindead_-class silly gore and _Alien_-class sci-fi horror, and, again, it becomes hard to take the horror seriously when everything feels like it's made of plasticine.

I think the cause of all this is the belief that [true art is angsty](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty), and that a story has to be "serious" in order to be good. Which leads to serious drama and themes being stapled onto works that do not benefit from them at all. Back to _Bulletstorm_, I'm sure they wanted to make something a silly gorefest, but someone at one point decided that they needed to make it "epic", and "epic" works must be heavy drama stuff.

So, what should we take from this? Well, don't be inconsistent. You can add drama to humor: it's been done well numerous times, from _EarthBound_ to _Portal_. But you have to be careful, and you should ask yourself: does it add anything to the story? Does it sends mixed messages to the player? And, more importantly, will it look like the development team was fighting with itself to push ideas?

If you're going for a silly over-the-top action parody, go ahead. In fact, go nuts. Don't faff about between ideas. Put your balls on the table and assume what you're aiming for. Tonal dissonance is the result of a cop out.
