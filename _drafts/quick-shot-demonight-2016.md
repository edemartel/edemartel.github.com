Every year, near the end of January, the Montreal chapter of the International Game Developer Association, the biggest non-profit working on behalf of game developers worlwide, makes a little event called the DemoNight. During that time, indie and not so indie game developers get to show off their current work. The only rule: your game must not have been released already in a finished state, although early access titles are fair game. Your game also needs to be interesting. Oh, and being well connected in the Montreal indie scene should help quite a bit. And it's a five minute real time demo: no trailers or pre-baked marketing bullshit is allowed.

So, [just like last year](http://deliriumcorp.com/2015/01/31/on-the-subject-of-demo-nights/), I was there. And, just like last year, I figured I'd give my quick thoughts on the subject. For the best experience, read this alongside [the list of games presented](http://www.igdamontreal.ca/events/demonight-2016/). I'll go on them in alphabetical order. As usual, those are just my short impressions based solely on the demos presented... although I might go off on some tangent if a game is particularly worth talking about.

So, let's go!

### _Alien Road Rage_

It's an endless runner where you have to drive into stuff in order to unlock more means to drive into stuff. Basically, it's _Carmageddon_ mixed with _Crossy Road_. They only presented the first level, which involved bursting into cows, which was a joke that ran out of steam fast. Overall, not really impressive.

### _Children of Zodiarcs_

Ever played _Fire Emblem_ or _Final Fantasy Tactics_? Well, it's exactly that: the linear _in medias res_ plot, the anime art style, the 3D world with big squares that's actually a 2D world in diguise... it's all there! There are unique points, though: characters perform their actions by drawing and playing cards, and you get to customize each unit's deck in between battles. And, instead of just rolling random numbers, you roll dies that can give various results from increased damage to special effects to card drawing. I'll keep an eye out for this one, since I always had a soft spot for tactical RPGs, and the special features might be enough to differentiate it from its source material.

As long as the plot doesn't suck.

### _Eagle Flight_

A VR flying game by the guys who made _Child of Light_. Probably as good as VR is going to get giving the current state of the technology.

### _Fat Mask_

I don't know about this one, honestly. It's a multiplayer combat game where, instead of punching people, you stick blocks next to each other to score points, and you try to prevent others from doing the same. It didn't feel as chaotic or frantic as they were hyping it up to be. It might get better over time, but, again, I don't really know.

### _Feudal Feud_

A _very_ slow paced massively multiplayer strategy game where players attempt to vassalize other players. It reminded me of old school Web based strategy games, except more graphical and with more diplomatic options. I'll keep following it.

### _Floor Kids the Game_

It's a dance game that's played with the fingers... or that's the theory anyway. The presenters made no attempt to showcase how the game was played, simply that it was about cartoony kids showing off to each other with what seemed like a very small pool of moves. It felt like the game was way too early in its development, and that the demo was more of an occasion to advertise their new narrative universe than the game itself.

### _Fulcrum_

_Journey_ on a snowboard, in first person, but without the story. Pretty bland, pretty uninteresting.

### _Goats & Gongs_

A student project from NAD. It's an interesting concept about guiding a goat through a temple, using shields to deflect beams of fire so that your little furry friend doesn't get roasted. Good level of quality considering who made it.

### _Leap of Fate_

That game was shown last year, and it doesn't feel like it changed much. Just like last year, it's an arena-based hack-and-slash that features waves of enemies in a small cramped environment. All of that is contextualized through card drawing: every new game, you get a new deck of card, and each card is a different event, like a new skill, or a combat encounter. This is mostly a graphical twist on the usual rogue-like dungeon crawling. As for the combat gameplay itself, it seems adequately twitchy, so I'll keep an eye on it.

### _Moon Hunters_

I've first heard about it when I went to a presentation about procedural game design at MIGS14. They were talking about the things they've learned while working on _Shattered Planet_, and how they were using it for their next game, _Moon Hunters_. Then I saw their demo last year, and then again this year. The game is a co-op action RPG in a procedurally generated world where every action build your own mythology. My understanding is that each one of your games gets remembered as a legend in the world you help create. I'll definitely pick this up at one point, the only question is _when_.

### _Open Bar_

A stylish and clean puzzle game about connecting lines. Probably going to be addictive for a lot of people, but it's not my kind of thing.

### _Stories: The Path of Destinies_

Another action RPG about smashing people in the face and dumping experience points in the same stats. You've all seen that before. This time the twist is that the story is presented as a book with a funky narrator who asks questions about "what are you going to do?", which is just a super clunky way of showing a level selection screen.

### _sU: The Quest for Meaning_

A game about jumping from platform to platform, collecting abstract tokens along the way. The developer hinted at a larger meaning, and that decifering that meaning was the true goal of the game. Intriguing, but I wonder if in the end it's just a marketing gimmick.

### _Tsuro_

A virtual adaptation of the classic board game of the same name. A lot of work went into making the game "feel" like an actual board game. Games can be played asynchronously with other players, or with AI opponents. Probably not my kind of stuff, but interesting nonetheless.

### _Ultimate Chicken Horse_

Was great last year, still great this year. For the unaware, UCH is a competitive platform game where players try to build a level all at the same time by placing objects and traps. Your goal is to make the level too hard for your opponents but easy enough for you. Has tremendous potential for becoming a super fun party game. They mentionned having online multiplayer that was "almost working"... one month away from release. Life is hard.

### _Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade_

_Battlefield_: Grim Dark edition. The network fucked up in the middle of the demo, so they didn't get to showoff what they've described as a "complex melee combat system". Aside from it, it looks like a somewhat decent multiplayer shooter.

### _We Happy Few_

Ooooh boy. I was looking forward to this one, because _Contrast_ was flawed but encouraging and think Compulsion makes at least unique stuff. And... this game is far from ready. It had the distinct honor of being the only game of the night to have actual frame rate drops. Overall performance was atrocious, which is strange for a game that doesn't look that good and runs on Unreal 4. As for the game itself, it looks to me like they thought about their core idea, which was stealth in plain sight using drugs and disguises, and then built a game around it by stapling together features that were popular at the time. So we have crafting and survival mechanics and a procedurally generated map. And their big unique thing about soma-style "happy drug"? It's just a post process filter with a different skybox. And I know it's not out yet, but all the other games shown during the evening ran fine, and _Contrast_ came out with terrible technical issues, so this raises questions about their development skills.

### _Zombie Cruise_

A zombie survival game... on a boat. You get two survivors on a cruise liner, and your goal is to make it out alive, completing objectives along the way. The gameplay was deliberately designed to look like a board game: your characters can move a set amount of tiles each turn, and you have to avoid getting zombie attacks, amongst other things. It surely is a fresh spin on the zombie genre, although I doubt it'll find its way on my playlist.

## Closing words

There were a lot of board games, puzzle games and otherwise turn based games this year. I understand they require fewer resources to build, but it's still intriguing. As for what I'm looking forward to the most, I have to say it's _Ultimate Chicken Horse_, _Moon Hunters_ and_Children of Zodiarcs_, roughly in that order. That is not to say the rest sucks. It's just that my playtime is somewhat limited and I prefer to focus on what really gets my nethers going. Which is, at the time of writing, probably _XCOM 2_.

That being said, it's great to see that the Montreal indie scene is as vibrant as ever! If I get to play any of those games, I'll be sure to write about it... as long as it's interesting enough, of course.
