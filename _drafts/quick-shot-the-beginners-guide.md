Recently I went around to play and subsequently finish, since it's very short, _The Beginner's Guide_. For those who are unaware, it's the latest title from Davey Wreden, the guy who made _The Stanley Parable_. I'm mostly writing this to offload my thoughts, as this made me think quite a bit, although it can probably be a review. Keep in mind, t's incredibly difficult to explain what's going on without spoiling it. That said, I have a bit of meta discussion beforehand, so I'll warn you off before the spoilers begin.

I tried TBG because of my [author support rule](http://deliriumcorp.com/2015/09/30/on-the-subject-of-author-support/): support the people whose work you like, and I quite liked _The Stanley Parable_, so I decided to give it a shot. Took me an hour and a half, and at the end I think I just stared at the menu for a while, not really knowing what to do with myself.

This game left me feeling a bit depressed. I won't say why yet (see the end of the article), but I have to say that TBG isn't fun. It's bleak and it leaves behind more questions than answers. It's also, unquestionably, art, so being enjoyable is not part of its purpose.

### Negative breakdown

I've read quite a bit of user and popular reviews about the game, and what I found especially interesting was all most negative reviews fell in the rough same categories. I'm not saying you can't dislike _The Beginner's Guide_, even I'm still having some problems with it. I do not regret the money and time I spent on it, and I would probably do it again. But I understand why someone wouldn't.

So, those negative reviews, they fall in three broad categories. First, there are those who just despise narrative exploration games, derisively calling them "walking simulators" and refusing to categorize them as a game. I was almost part of that group some time ago, when I denied the title of GOTY contender to _The Stanley Parable_ because I considered it be an interactive story rather than an actual game. I don't want to wander in the messy debate of what is a game and what isn't, but I'll just ask this: if _SimCity_ is a game despite not having a clearly defined win condition, why wouldn't TSP be too?

Another group finds the similarities between _The Beginner's Guide_ and _The Stanley Parable_. After all, they're both narrative exploration games, viewed from a first person perspective, developed with the Source engine, with a narrator guiding you the whole way, a WASD and mouse control scheme and even the same developer behind the two! And as such, they claim that TBG is a spiritual successor to TSP and therefore should be compared to it. And, indeed, if you do that, you'll find that TBG is inferior to its predecessor: its linear, there's only one ending, the narrator isn't as good, and it's overall about a tenth of the length.

And finally, there's the group that takes the game at face value, as a linear sequence of story events, which the narrator is simply describing. This is an interesting school of thought, the idea that subtext does not exist and that stories are simply chronologies. This also implies that the narrator is reliable and only exists to offer a different view on the same events.

And that's that third category I want to address. And for that, I'm going to assume you've finished the game in order to understand my point, which also means I might have to spoil some things. 

Just before that, though, here's my **verdict:** try it. It might not be great, but it's worth experiencing, and it'll be over quickly anyway. And if you think it's expensive, well, it's the price of a ticket to a museum or a film.

### Spoilers below

So, the game ends with a bang and puts back the whole thing into perspective. Were Davey and Coda really friends? How many lampposts were actually added by Davey? In fact, considering how easy it is for Davey to modify the games themselves, how much of them is transformed?

I think the point of the game isn't to answer those questions. I think the point of it is to be some starting ground for a discussion. You know, like any art piece. 

As for what I think, I don't know, really. I've been reading quite a bit of things on the subject, and I like all the different analyses. Maybe Davey is an abusive fan of Coda. Maybe he's a critic who wants to force his interpretation into the games themselves. Maybe they were friends once but Davey is a selfish jerk so they're not anymore. Hell, there's a very convincing theory that Davey and Coda are two sides of the same person, that Davey is the business side and Coda is the creative side.

So, again, I don't know. Could be anything. Maybe you were expecting my own analysis of the thing, but I'm not sure I'm up for that. I like reading those kinds of things much more than I like writing them, and although sometimes I'll pitch an article, in this case it's leaving me mostly dry. But who knows, some inspiration might come to me while I'm sitting on the toilet.

So there you have it. _The Beginner's Guide_ is, for lack of a better word, art, and I'll happily read about it as people wrap their heads around it and come up with interesting answers to all those questions.
