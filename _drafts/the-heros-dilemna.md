The man laid there, gravely wounded. Grasping his stomach, he was losing a lot of blood, and he wouldn't last more than a few minutes. He was fully aware of that fact.

<!-- more -->

-- Eh, that's unfortunate.

Dalton stood in front of him. He had nothing but contempt for the wounded man, who had used him as a meat shield for the entirety of the operation. And now that he was about to die, he wasn't even sure he wanted to waste an energy unit from his carbine to end his suffering.

-- You brought this on yourself.<br />
-- Yeah, maybe you're right. Doesn't make a big difference right now.

Dalton nodded. His current plan was to simply turn around and walk out of this derelict installation. He would go back to that crime lord and tell him the mission was completed. After all, his job was to simply assist the team. Since they're all dead now, then his work is done. And then he'd get his hands on that spare part and be one step closer to going back home. In his mind, he could almost see it. The wounded man's ragged voice broke him out of his daydreaming.

-- Look, I have a request...<br />
-- You almost got me killed _three times_. I don't think you're in a position to ask something to me.<br />
-- It's not for me! It's for everyone!<br />
-- I don't care about "everyone". I'm from here. I'm not even from this world. Why should I risk my life?

The man coughed. There as blood on his palm. It was becoming increasingly harder for him to stay conscious. But he had to make his request. He had to.

-- Please, hear me out. As my final wish.

Despite having no reason to accept, Dalton figured he could at least listen.

-- Go on.<br />
-- Right. Look, the wasteland outside? Did you ever wonder how can a desert have such fertile land and so much rain?<br />
-- I did not pause to taste the earth, no.<br />
-- It's artificial. A thousand year ago there was a forest here. Then the Old Ones disappeared, and without proper maintenance their darkstone plant broke down and started leaking radiation.

Dalton did not like that piece of information.

-- You mean we're getting irradiated right now?<br />
-- The radiations are only dangerous to plant life. But it's why nothing grows around the power plant.<br />
-- Why are you telling me this?

It was getting difficult to breathe, but he had to go through with it.

-- Our objective was to shut down the power plant. Hopefully, within a few years, the wasteland will be green again, and we'll be able to start cultivating the land.<br />
-- I still don't see why I should care. Since I came here, everything and everyone has been trying to kill me. <br />
-- Please. I know that deep down, you want to do good. You want to make things better. Your cynical mask isn't fooling me.<br />

The man stopped talking as he was hit by another coughing fit.

-- Please. Finish our job. Save the world...

And then he stopped moving. Looking at him, Dalton realized he never knew his name. But it was too late for that now. He turned around and looked at the floor below. The darklings were still blocking the way to the center of the plant, where the control center was located. The exit was in the opposing direction. He could probably easily sneak his way out and get as far away as possible from this forsaken building. Get to his employer. Make him honor his end of the deal. 

And yet... he kept thinking about what the man had said. He shook his head. He wasn't a hero. He was just an earthling, lost in another dimension. He was way over his head. Could he really make a difference? Nobody would know he did it, but still? As he stood there, he felt that he could really use a second opinion right now. But the man was dead, and his symbiote didn't talk much.

He let out a long sigh and shot a glance at the dead man's body. 

-- Alright, but just this once.

He grabbed his carbine, removed the safety, and then looked at the darklings. There were six of them. He had the high ground and the element of surprise. Easy enough. He took aim, and opened fire.
