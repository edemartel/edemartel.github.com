This will be short. I recently fixed a few bugs thanks to feedback from some friends of mine (they know who they are), and I also enabled comments through Disqus. I know they're technically evil, but I'm willing to give them a chance. Be wary that I am ready to pull the plug as soon as I smell the faint scent of bullshit coming out of there. For now, I'm gonna leave things unmoderated. We'll see how things goes.

So, don't hesitate to leave comments! I'll have an actual article coming in the next few days (probably this weekend). It's gonna be about feminism, just to stir shit up.
