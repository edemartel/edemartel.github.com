So, yeah, I decided to open a blog. If you've read my [about](about.html) page, you probably know I used to own one (in French, no less). So, what made me start over and create a new one, hmm?
<!-- more -->

Let's look at why my first blog "failed", in a sense. I initially opened it to document my travels into the strange and uncharted land of V8, Google's JavaScript engine used for the Chrome browser. I wanted to see if it could be used as a scripting layer for a game (note to non programmers: a scripting layer is something used to speed up game development by using a simpler language to write some of the game's code). I did this because there was little to no documentation on V8, so I figured I might as well do some trial and error and leave information for others to use.

I eventually got bored with V8 (that happens often with my side projects), so I stopped writing. I came back to my blog a few times to leave some of the programming tricks I encountered, but that's it. Last update was on april 10, 2011. Nothing since then, and I have no interest in resurrecting it, for multiple reasons. First, I want to write in English in order to reach a wider audience. I also don't like Blogger very much. Finally, I don't want to only write about code.

Because that's it, really: I like programming a lot, but I'm not that passionate about it. I might have an article on that once in a while, but I'm much more interested in other things. Hence the category "on the subject of", ("otso" for short), that can be summed up as: anything I'm thinking about right now. Other potential subjects might include game design, analysis or reviewing. Really, I like games a lot. I'll try not to bore you too much with _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, and I'll probably not be talking a lot about _League of Legends_ or _StarCraft 2_ strategy because I'm unskilled and rusty respectively.

In short, that's gonna be my brain in textual form. Hopefully it'll work this time.

No promises.
