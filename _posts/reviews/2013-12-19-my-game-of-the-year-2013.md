So, 2013 comes to a close. I hope you had a good year. I sure did. I thought about doing some "year in review" thing, but I got lazy, so I figured I'd just write about what I think is the best game of 2013. And by that I mean the game I played in 2013 that left the largest impact on me, and not which game released in 2013 is the best. Every media outlet and their dog does that, so if you're looking for that, just go to Polygon or Kotaku. I'm betting that _Grand Theft Auto V_ will top most charts.

By that rule, my game of the year 2011 is _Bastion_, and the 2012 one is _Fallout: New Vegas_, and while _Bastion_ did came out in 2011, _New Vegas_ is a 2010 title, so I was really late there. However, the fourth and final DLC was released in late 2011, so it's not that bad. I can't remember what blew my mind in 2010. Maybe _StarCraft 2_? Or was it _Assassin's Creed 2_? I don't really know. And before that, I wasn't playing enough games to really be able to make up my mind on that. So, with that in mind, let's talk about 2013.

While writing this article, I tried remembering the games I played in 2013. I remember how _BioShock Infinite_ was pretty, entertaining and ultimately pretentious as fuck. I remembered the _SimCity_ disaster, and how they managed to repeat the same mistakes that Blizzard did with _Diablo 3_ despite saying several months beforehand that they wouldn't. I recall that _Dishonored_ was a technically competent but bland game, [_Crysis 2_](http://deliriumcorp.com/2013/08/21/micro-review-crysis-2/) was a very good shooter, and _Darksiders_ and its sequel reached the dizzying heights of "basically all right". There's also both [_Saints Row: The Third_ and its sequel _Saints Row 4_](http://deliriumcorp.com/2013/10/04/micro-review-saints-row-4/), which are very entertaining but not really thought provoking. I also started but never finished several games, including _Metro 2033_, _Thomas Was Alone_ and _Hotline Miami_.

So I looked back and felt "meh". I couldn't choose. And then I realized that 2013 is the year I discovered _League of Legends_. I've already sunk hundreds of hours in this game. In fact, I spent more time playing LoL in 8 months than I did on _StarCraft 2_ over two years. So, I was about to cast LoL as my GOTY 2013 when I realized that, while I enjoy the game a lot, it didn't really strike a chord. It's fun, but it didn't made me think that much, except on the strategy or "metagame" side of things.

Then I realized that 2013 was the first year in my life during which all my gaming was done on a PC, discounting that one time where I helped my brother go through a particulary hairy moment in _Dead Space 2_. So I went on Stream to look at my purchase history. I noticed I bought a lot of Humble Bundles, but didn't play any of them with the exception of the THQ and Origin ones. There's also the very interesting _The Stanley Parable_ and the disappointing _Gone Home_. Both of those are disqualified since they're not really games but rather [interactive stories](http://deliriumcorp.com/2013/10/26/on-the-subject-of-interactive-stories/). So I kept scrolling, and I noticed something very interesting.

As it turns out, I purchased _Spec Ops: The Line_ on January 9th, 2013. I know that's almost 2012, but, SOTL blew my mind so hard that I can't help but mention it here again. Go buy it. You won't be disappointed. Or, rather, you probably will, but you'll also feel like you've actually learned something.

So, there you have it, folks: my game of the year 2013 is none other than _Spec Ops: The Line_. I know, kind of a cop out, but this is _my_ blog, _I_ make the rules, so suck it. If you want to know more the game and why I'm recommending it, I wrote [an article](http://deliriumcorp.com/2013/08/24/on-the-subject-of-deeper-games/) on it, and on why it is an important game.

In any case, happy holidays! I'll be doing nothing productive at all for the next two weeks, and that include writing for this blog. So, with that said, I'll see you in 2014 with a new article. Remember that "Guide to gaming for newcomers" thing I was talking about? I'm gonna kick that off then.

Peace out!
