## Hi! 

I'm Etienne de Martel, tool programmer at [Ludia](http://ludia.com/) and all around idealist. I decided to start blogging after I realized there were lots of things I wanted to write about, yet never took the time to do so. I once had a blog, but I did not touch it for a few years (you can still find it [here](http://deliriumcorp.blogspot.com/); warning, it's in French). I figured I would have more chances of success if I wrote about any subject that crossed my mind and not just programming, as I'm not really a "code in your spare time" kind of guy, so most tricks I find are not that interesting. Hopefully it'll work out this time.

As you can see on the right, I'm a fairly good contributor to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). I also hang out a lot (under my real name, of course) on the [Lounge&lt;C++&gt;](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/10/loungec). Come and say hi, but remember we won't answer your programming-related questions unless you try to be a member of our little community first. That means introduce yourself and try discussing with us _before_ asking away.

Also, Rainbow Dash is best pony. Deal with it.
